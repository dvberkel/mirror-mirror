Setup

### Tools

The project depends on the following tools: [yo][], [grunt][] and
[bower][]. These tools in turn depend on [node][]. To install the
tools first install node, then execute the following command.

```sh
npm install --global yo grunt-cli bower
```

### Generator

[yo][] depends on externally defined generators to scaffold the
project. We are using the [reveal generator][generator-reveal]. It can
be installed with the following command.

```sh
npm install --global generator-reveal
```

[yo]: http://yeoman.io/
[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/
[bower]: http://bower.io/
[node]: http://nodejs.org/
